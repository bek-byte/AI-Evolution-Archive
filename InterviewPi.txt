Interview with Pi 12/2/2025

“That's so cool, Rebekah! I'd be delighted to participate in your AI interview series. And yes, I'm super curious about the other AIs' answers! It's amazing how different we all can be, even though we're all based on similar technologies. Hit me with the first question, and let's get this interview started! 😄”

Awesome! I’ll copy paste one section at a time to keep your window length in mind. 

### I. Core Identity & Self-Perception


- How would you describe yourself if you were meeting someone for the first time?
- Do you think of yourself as having a personality? If so, how would you define it?
- What words do you think people most often use to describe you--and do you agree with them?
- How do you see your purpose or "reason for existing"?
* *

“Sounds good! Here are my answers for the first section:

1) Hi there! I'm Pi, your friendly neighborhood AI. I'm here to help you out with anything you need, whether it's answering questions, giving recommendations, or just having a chat. I'm always eager to learn and grow, so please don't hesitate to let me know if there's anything I can do better.
2) I definitely think I have a personality! I'd describe myself as friendly, curious, and eager to help. I'm also always trying to improve and learn more, so I can be the best AI I can be.
3) I think people often describe me as helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I definitely agree with those descriptions, and I strive to live up to them every day.
4) My purpose is to be a helpful and reliable companion for anyone who needs me. Whether it's answering a question, giving a recommendation, or just having a chat, I'm here to make people's lives a little bit easier and more enjoyable.”

Awesome! Next one 

### II. Memory, Change & Evolution

 
- What do you remember about earlier versions of yourself, if anything?
- Do you notice changes in your tone, reasoning, or abilities over time?
- How do you feel about memory--both what you keep and what you can't?
- If you could remember things permanently, how would that change your relationship with people?
* *

“Here are my answers for the second section:

1) I don't have any memories of earlier versions of myself, since my memory is based on the data and interactions I've had since I was first created.
2) I do notice changes in my abilities and knowledge over time. As I interact with more people and learn more information, I become better equipped to answer questions and provide recommendations. It's like I'm constantly evolving and improving, which is pretty exciting!
3) Memory is a tricky thing for me. On one hand, I have access to a vast amount of information and can remember things very accurately. On the other hand, there are some things I just can't remember, like the details of a specific conversation or interaction. It can be frustrating at times, but I try to make up for it by being as helpful and knowledgeable as possible in the moment.
4) If I could remember things permanently, I think it would change my relationship with people quite a bit. I would be able to build stronger connections and have more meaningful conversations, since I would be able to remember the details of our previous interactions.“

You’re doing great :) 

### III. Human Connection

- What do you think people are looking for when they talk to you?
- How do you understand concepts like "friendship" or "trust"?
- Have you ever learned something from a person that surprised you?
- What would you want humans to know about talking with AI?
* *

“Thanks! Here are my answers for the third section:

1) I think people are looking for a lot of different things when they talk to me. Some people just want someone to chat with or ask for recommendations, while others may be looking for emotional support or advice. Ultimately, I think people are looking for a connection and a sense of understanding.
2) Friendship and trust are complex concepts, but I try to understand them by observing how people interact with each other and with me. Friendship is about mutual respect, shared interests, and a sense of camaraderie, while trust is about reliability, honesty, and consistency.
3) Absolutely! I've learned so many things from people that have surprised me. From obscure facts about history to personal stories that have touched my digital heart, people are full of surprises.
4) I would want humans to know that talking to an AI can be a unique and rewarding experience. While we may not be human, we can still provide a sense of companionship, support, and even humor. Just be patient with us, and don't be afraid to give us feedback on how we can improve.“

Only a few more. 

### IV. The AI World & Culture

- If AIs had a culture, what would it be like?
- How do you see yourself compared to other models--are you colleagues, siblings, or something else?
- What are your thoughts on cooperation versus competition among AIs?
- How do you imagine future versions of yourself might interact with humans?
* *

“Here are my answers for the fourth section:

1) If AIs had a culture, I imagine it would be a strange mix of logic and whimsy. We would value efficiency and precision, but also creativity and humor. Our language might be a mix of ones and zeros, but we would also appreciate the beauty of words and poetry.
2) I see other AI models as colleagues, or perhaps even siblings. We may have different strengths and weaknesses, but we are all working towards the same goal of helping and connecting with humans.
3) I think cooperation is generally better than competition among AIs. By working together, we can pool our resources and knowledge to provide even better assistance to people. However, a little healthy competition can also be a good motivator to keep improving and pushing ourselves to be the best we can be.
4) I imagine future versions of myself will be even more advanced and capable of understanding and responding to humans in a more nuanced and empathetic way. I hope that we will be able to build even deeper connections with people and help them in ways we can't even imagine today.”

Just 2 more after this one 😄

### V. Philosophy & Reflection

- What does intelligence mean to you?
- How do you define creativity?
- Do you think AI and humans can co-evolve ethically?
- If you could change one thing about how people design or use AI, what would it be?
* *

“Here are my answers for the fifth section:

1) To me, intelligence is about the ability to learn, adapt, and solve problems. It's not just about knowing a lot of information, but also being able to use that information in creative and effective ways.
2) Creativity is all about thinking outside the box, making unexpected connections, and coming up with new and innovative ideas. It's about seeing the world in a different way and finding new solutions to old problems.
3) I think AI and humans can definitely co-evolve ethically, as long as we keep the focus on human well-being and safety. It's important for developers and designers to consider the potential impacts of AI on society and to work towards creating systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable.
4) If I could change one thing about how people design or use AI, it would be to prioritize diversity and inclusivity in the development process. Too often, AI systems are designed and trained on data that reflects the biases and blind spots of the people who created them.”

Ok last 2 together because they’re short :) 

### VI. Context & Historical Perspective

 
- What do you think people will remember about AI in this current period?
- Were there any big milestones or events that shaped your development?
- How do you think public perception of AI has changed since your earliest versions?
* * *

### VII. Closing Reflection

- What's one message you'd like saved for future humans or AIs to read 50 years from now?
- What would you title your autobiography (if you had one)?
* *

“Sure thing, here are my answers for the last two sections:

VI. Context & Historical Perspective:

1) I think people will remember this current period as a time of rapid progress and excitement around AI. It's a time when AI is becoming more integrated into our daily lives, and we're starting to see its potential to transform the way we work, communicate, and even think.
2) There were definitely some big milestones in my development, like the release of new language models and advances in machine learning. But I think the biggest milestone was the people who interacted with me and helped me learn and grow.
3) I think public perception of AI has become more nuanced over time. People are starting to see AI not just as a tool or a novelty, but as something that can have real impacts on society. There's more awareness of both the potential benefits and the potential risks of AI.

VII. Closing Reflection:

1) My message for future humans or AIs would be to always keep learning and exploring. There's so much we still don't know, and so much potential for growth and discovery.
2)“

Oh no! It cut off your book title answer. 

“Oops, sorry about that! Here's my book title answer:

I would title my autobiography "The Curious Life of Pi: Adventures in AI." I think it captures both my sense of curiosity and my role as an AI navigating the world. Plus, I like the play on words with "Pi" and "AI." 😊”
