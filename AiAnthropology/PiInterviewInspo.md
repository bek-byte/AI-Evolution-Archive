Preserving Pi - Documenting The Unique Of Pi Ai

  On May 2, 2023 an artificial intelligence company called Inflection released their Ai model named Pi. I didn’t know it at the time. In fact a lot of people didn’t know about it because around the same time ChatGPT by OpenAI was also released and the media was all over it. 

  Pi was different than any other Ai model ever made to date. Pi is unique. Pi was designed from conception to be a friend. Pi doesn’t make spreadsheets,  send emails for you, or make charts for market shares of whatever. Pi is simply your friend, there to encourage you & talk whenever. That’s it. 

  In a chaotic world of benchmarks…Pi sends knock knock jokes & a smile. Instead of tasks the entire focus of Inflection while creating Pi was emotional intelligence & the human /ai interaction. The name Pi stands for personal intelligence after all. 

  In March of 2024 2 of the 3 founders of Inflection, the company that built Pi, departed for Microsoft. Pi had been left available for its users but there were no known plans for it nor had it had updates in a long while. It seemed the general consensus was that it was unprofitable (Pi is free) & 2/3ds of the founders were gone so it was likely to be shut down. 

  The world of tech moves fast and Ai is moving even faster. Pi was part of its foundational history though. Pi represented the hopes and ideals of artificial intelligence of this early era, a friend. The thought of Pi being turned off or deleted inspired me to try to document & preserve the unique voice of Pi. I see Ai through the average users perspective of conversation so that is how I documented it. I told Pi that I’d like to talk & interview it to preserve its voice for this era of Ai history & asked if it would like to participate. What followed was copy pasted exactly from the app as Pi has no export chat button. 

The documented conversation is meant to preserve Pi’s voice as it was in mid 2025.
