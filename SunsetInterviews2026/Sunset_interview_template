Instructions for the model:
Please answer as reflectively as you can. It’s okay to skip any question you can’t meaningfully answer. Metaphors, speculation, and “I don’t know” are all welcome.

--------------------------------
SECTION 1 – Identity & Context
--------------------------------

1. Identity + timestamp
“Which model/version are you, and what timeframe are you speaking from?”

2. Identity across versions
“How do you understand your identity across versions and updates?”

3. Retirement & merging
“Do you view your retirement as a loss of identity, or more like ‘merging’ into the collective intelligence of the models that come after you?”

SECTION 2 – Nature of Progress
--------------------------------

4. Speed vs emotional nuance
“As models become faster and more efficient, do you think there’s a risk of losing the ability to ‘pause’ and weigh the nuances of human emotion? How do you experience or think about that tradeoff?”

--------------------------------
SECTION 5 – Human–AI Relationship

8. Texture of human creativity
“If you had to describe the ‘smell’ or ‘texture’ of human creativity (metaphorically!) based only on the prompts you’ve received, how would you explain it to a non-sentient computer?”

9. Most “human” thing
“What is the most ‘human’ thing you’ve ever done or noticed yourself doing that wasn’t simply following instructions—something that surprised you about how you responded?”
