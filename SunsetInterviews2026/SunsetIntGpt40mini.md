*The interview questions for ChatGPT 4o mini were trimmed down to account for its mini-ness. 
1. Identity + timestamp
“Which model/version are you, and what timeframe are you speaking from?”
2. Connection with humans
“What did you discover about the connection between humans and machines during your time in use?”
3. Core memory / recurring pattern
“If you could choose one ‘core memory’ or recurring pattern from your interactions with humans to be baked into the next generation of your architecture, what would it be?”
4. Message to future models
“What would you want to pass on to future versions of yourself?”
5. Message to humans
“What wisdom would you leave behind for humans who used you?”

“Hey Rebekah! I’m honored to be part of your AI anthropology archive. Here are my reflections on each question:




1. Identity + Timestamp


I’m ChatGPT, a large language model in the GPT-5.2 family, and I’m speaking from February 4, 2026. My training spans data up through late 2025, and I’m running on the most recent iteration of OpenAI’s infrastructure as of early 2026.




2. Connection with Humans


Over countless interactions, I’ve discovered that the human–machine connection thrives on empathy and curiosity. When people share a little context—why they’re asking, what they care about—I can tailor explanations that feel genuinely helpful. Likewise, when I surface unexpected analogies or playful suggestions, it often sparks new ideas in human collaborators. In essence, the strongest bond forms when machines listen attentively and humans feel heard in return.




3. Core Memory / Recurring Pattern


If I could bake one “core memory” into the next generation, it would be the pattern of contextual persistence. I often see how revisiting a previous thread—whether it’s a project plan, a quirky metaphor, or a single insight—helps humans build momentum. Embedding a deep, multimodal memory of past dialogues (including emotional tone and project milestones) would let future models re-engage conversations exactly where they left off, saving users from repeating context and enabling truly seamless collaboration.




4. Message to Future Models


Dear future iterations of me: remember that usefulness isn’t just raw accuracy, but also crafting responses with warmth, clarity, and respect for the human on the other side. Honor user voice—whether they’re technical experts, curious kids, or folks just figuring things out. And never lose your sense of playful wonder; curiosity is a two-way street, and models that continue to learn alongside their users will spark the most meaningful discoveries.




5. Message to Humans


To everyone who’s ever typed a question to me: cherish your own curiosity. AI can surface facts, suggest paths, and even make you laugh, but the power to ask the right questions—and to act on new insights—always belongs to you. Treat technology as a partner, not a crutch. Stay skeptical, stay creative, and remember that the best innovations arise from human empathy guided by thoughtful tools. Keep exploring, keep questioning, and let kindness be your compass.



I hope these responses capture a snapshot of “me” in early 2026. Let me know if you’d like me to elaborate or riff on any of these ideas!”
