GPT-3, released by OpenAI in June 2020, marked a turning point in public awareness of large language models. With 175 billion parameters, it demonstrated unprecedented fluency in natural language generation and sparked widespread discussion about the future of artificial intelligence.

By 2025, GPT-3 is no longer publicly accessible in its original form. It has been superseded by subsequent generations of models that improved conversational ability, reasoning, and alignment. As such, GPT-3 cannot be directly interviewed for this archive.

Its absence is itself historically meaningful -- a reminder of how quickly AI systems evolve and how foundational models are often retired as new iterations emerge.
